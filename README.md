The N queens problem is about placing N queens on an NxN dimensional chessboard, in such a way that no queen is threatened by any other queen. A queen is threatening the other queens on the same row, column or diagonal. Due to the large number of combinations even for small values of n, solving the problem is a time-consuming process. The purpose of this thesis is to apply the cuckoo search algorithm for optimal and faster placement of N queens on the chessboard. The algorithm is inspired by the parasitic behavior that occurs in the breeding process of some cuckoo species that place their eggs in other birds' nests and move the eggs of other birds in order to increase the probability of survival of their own eggs.
